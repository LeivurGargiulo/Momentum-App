# Onboarding Language Selection Feature

## Overview

This feature adds a language selection step to the first-time onboarding experience, allowing users to choose between English and Spanish before setting up their activities.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

1. **Modified Onboarding Component** (`src/components/Onboarding.jsx`):
   - Added a new step 0 for language selection
   - Updated step indicator to show 3 steps instead of 2
   - Added language selection UI with visual feedback
   - Integrated with existing i18n system

2. **Updated Translation Files**:
   - Added new translation keys for language selection step
   - English (`src/locales/en.json`):
     - `chooseLanguage`: "Choose Your Language"
     - `chooseLanguageDescription`: "Select your preferred language for the app. You can change this later in settings."
     - `continue`: "Continue"
   - Spanish (`src/locales/es.json`):
     - `chooseLanguage`: "Elige Tu Idioma"
     - `chooseLanguageDescription`: "Selecciona tu idioma preferido para la aplicación. Puedes cambiarlo más tarde en la configuración."
     - `continue`: "Continuar"

### User Experience Flow

1. **Step 0 - Language Selection**:
   - User sees welcome message in their browser's default language
   - Two language options presented: English and Español
   - Visual feedback shows selected language with checkmark
   - Continue button proceeds to activity setup

2. **Step 1 - Activity Setup** (unchanged):
   - User can add custom activities or use defaults
   - All text now appears in the selected language

3. **Step 2 - Confirmation** (unchanged):
   - Final confirmation before starting the app
   - Text appears in the selected language

### Technical Implementation

- **Language Persistence**: Uses existing localStorage mechanism (`momentum-language` key)
- **Default Activities**: Automatically creates activities in the selected language
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing i18n system
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes with proper mobile layout

### Key Features

- ✅ **First-time Experience**: Language selection appears only during onboarding
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of selected language
- ✅ **Persistence**: Language choice is saved and persists across sessions
- ✅ **Localized Content**: All onboarding text appears in selected language
- ✅ **Default Activities**: Activities are created in the correct language
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Proper contrast and hover states for all interactive elements

### Testing

To test the feature:

1. **Clear localStorage** to reset onboarding state:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('activity-tracker-activities');
   localStorage.removeItem('momentum-language');
   ```

2. **Refresh the page** to trigger onboarding flow

3. **Test both languages**:
   - Select English and verify all text appears in English
   - Select Spanish and verify all text appears in Spanish
   - Verify default activities are created in the correct language

### Future Enhancements

- Add more languages (French, German, Portuguese, etc.)
- Add language detection based on browser settings
- Add language-specific date/time formatting
- Add RTL language support
