### Language Switching

Users can easily switch between languages in the Settings page. The language preference is saved in localStorage and persists between sessions.

## Data Backup & Restore

Momentum includes comprehensive data backup and restore functionality that works entirely offline.

### Exporting Your Data

1. **Navigate to Settings**: Open the app and go to the Settings page
2. **Export Data**: Tap the "Export Data" button in the Data Management section
3. **Download**: A JSON file will be automatically downloaded with a timestamped filename (e.g., `momentum_backup_2025-01-15_14-30-25.json`)

The exported file contains:
- All your activities and their order
- Complete daily tracking data with completion status and notes
- App settings (dark mode, language preference)
- Export metadata (timestamp, version, data summary)

### Importing/Restoring Data

1. **Navigate to Settings**: Open the app and go to the Settings page
2. **Import Data**: Tap the "Import Data" button in the Data Management section
3. **Select File**: Choose a previously exported JSON backup file
4. **Resolve Conflicts**: If conflicts are detected, the app will guide you through resolution options

### Conflict Resolution

When importing data, Momentum intelligently detects and helps you resolve conflicts:

#### Activity Conflicts
- **Same ID**: When an imported activity has the same ID as an existing one
- **Same Name**: When an imported activity has the same name as an existing one
- **Resolution Options**:
  - Skip imported activity (keep existing)
  - Overwrite existing activity with imported data

#### Daily Data Conflicts
- **Same Date**: When you already have data for a specific date
- **Resolution Options**:
  - Skip imported data (keep existing)
  - Overwrite existing data with imported data
  - Merge data (combine completed activities and append notes)

#### Settings Conflicts
- **Existing Settings**: When you already have app settings configured
- **Resolution Options**:
  - Keep existing settings
  - Overwrite with imported settings

### Data Validation

The app validates all imported files to ensure:
- Valid JSON format
- Required data structure
- Proper data types
- Export metadata integrity

Invalid files will show a clear error message explaining the issue.

### Backup Best Practices

1. **Regular Backups**: Export your data weekly or monthly
2. **Multiple Copies**: Keep backups in different locations (cloud storage, local files)
3. **Test Restores**: Periodically test importing a backup to ensure it works
4. **Version Compatibility**: Backups are compatible across app versions

### File Format

Backup files are standard JSON with the following structure:
```json
{
  "activities": [...],
  "dailyData": {...},
  "settings": {...},
  "exportDate": "2025-01-15T14:30:25.123Z",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "appName": "Momentum",
  "dataSummary": {
    "totalActivities": 5,
    "totalDays": 30,
    "dateRange": {
      "start": "2024-12-15",
      "end": "2025-01-15"
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### PWA Development
The app uses Vite PWA plugin for service worker generation and manifest creation. Key files:

- `vite.config.js` - PWA configuration
- `public/pwa-icon.svg` - App icon
- `src/components/PWAInstallPrompt.jsx` - Install prompt
- `src/components/OfflineIndicator.jsx` - Offline status
- `src/components/UpdateNotification.jsx` - Update notifications

### Localization Development
The app uses react-i18next for internationalization. Key files:

- `src/i18n.js` - i18n configuration
- `src/locales/en.json` - English translations
- `src/locales/es.json` - Spanish translations
- `src/components/LanguageSwitcher.jsx` - Language switcher component

### Data Management Development
The app includes comprehensive data management utilities. Key files:

- `src/utils/storage.js` - Core storage functions with export/import
- `src/components/ImportConflictResolver.jsx` - Conflict resolution UI
- `src/components/Settings.jsx` - Settings page with data management

## Adding New Languages

To add support for a new language:

1. **Create translation file**: Add a new JSON file in `src/locales/` (e.g., `fr.json`)

2. **Add translations**: Copy the structure from `en.json` and translate all values:
```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "today": "Aujourd'hui",
    "stats": "Statistiques",
    "settings": "Param√®tres"
  },
  // ... translate all other keys
}
```

3. **Update i18n configuration**: Add the new language to `src/i18n.js`:
```javascript
import frTranslations from './locales/fr.json';

// In the resources object:
resources: {
  en: { translation: enTranslations },
  es: { translation: esTranslations },
  fr: { translation: frTranslations } // Add this line
}

// Update getAvailableLanguages function:
export const getAvailableLanguages = () => {
  return [
    { code: 'en', name: 'English', nativeName: 'English' },
    { code: 'es', name: 'Spanish', nativeName: 'Espa√±ol' },
    { code: 'fr', name: 'French', nativeName: 'Fran√ßais' } // Add this line
  ];
};
```

4. **Test the new language**: Switch to the new language in the app and verify all translations work correctly.

### Translation Keys Structure

The app uses nested translation keys for better organization:

- `navigation.*` - Navigation labels
- `onboarding.*` - Onboarding flow text
- `dailyTracking.*` - Daily tracking interface
- `statistics.*` - Statistics and charts
- `settings.*` - Settings page
- `messages.*` - Success/error messages
- `errors.*` - Error messages
- `pwa.*` - PWA-specific text
- `activityManager.*` - Activity management interface
- `import.*` - Import/export and conflict resolution text

## Data Storage

All user data is stored locally in the browser:

- **Activities**: List of user-defined activities with IDs and order
- **Daily Data**: Completion status and notes for each day
- **Settings**: User preferences (dark mode, language, etc.)

### Data Export/Import
The app supports comprehensive data export and import via JSON files in the Settings section, including:

- **Smart Conflict Detection**: Automatically identifies data conflicts
- **Flexible Resolution**: Multiple options for handling conflicts
- **Data Validation**: Ensures backup file integrity
- **Metadata Tracking**: Includes export timestamps and version info

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
