## Key Features Explained

### Activity Management
The app uses a centralized state management system with Zustand. Activities are stored with an `order` property to maintain their sequence. The `ActivityManager` component provides a modal interface for managing activities with:

- **Add**: Quick form to add new activities
- **Edit**: Inline editing with save/cancel options
- **Delete**: Confirmation dialog with historical data preservation
- **Reorder**: Up/down buttons for reordering activities

### Data Persistence
All data is automatically saved to localStorage:
- **Activities**: List of activity definitions with order
- **Daily Data**: Completion status and notes per day
- **Settings**: User preferences like dark mode

### Mobile-First Design
The app is designed with mobile users in mind:
- Bottom navigation for easy thumb access
- Floating action button for quick access to activity management
- Touch-friendly button sizes and spacing
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

## Customization

### Adding New Features
The modular architecture makes it easy to add new features:

1. **New Components**: Add to `src/components/`
2. **State Management**: Extend `useStore.js` with new actions
3. **Storage**: Add new storage functions in `storage.js`
4. **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS classes for consistent design

### Theming
The app uses Tailwind CSS with a custom color scheme. To modify the theme:

1. Update `tailwind.config.js` for color changes
2. Modify `src/index.css` for component styles
3. Update dark mode classes throughout components
