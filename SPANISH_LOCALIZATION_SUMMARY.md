## Technical Implementation

### Date Localization
```javascript
// Updated date formatting to use Spanish locale
const formatDate = (dateString) => {
  const date = new Date(dateString);
  const currentLanguage = localStorage.getItem('momentum-language') || 'en';
  const locale = currentLanguage === 'es' ? esLocale : undefined;
  return format(date, t('dateNavigation.dateFormat'), { locale });
};
```

### Language Detection
- **localStorage**: Checks for saved language preference
- **Browser Language**: Falls back to browser's preferred language
- **Default**: Uses English as final fallback

### Language Persistence
- Language preferences stored in localStorage
- Persists between sessions
- Automatic language switching with immediate UI updates

## Quality Assurance
